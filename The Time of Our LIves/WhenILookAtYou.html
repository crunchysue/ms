<body>Everybody needs inspiration<br />
Everybody needs a song<br />
A beautiful melody<br />

When the nights are long<br />
<br />
'cause there is no guarantee<br />
That this life is easy<br />
<br />
Yea when my world is falling apart<br />
When there's no light<br />
To break up the dark<br />
That's when I<br />
I look at you<br />

<br />
When the waves are flooding the shore<br />
And I can't find my way home any more<br />
That's when I<br />
I look at you<br />
<br />
When I look at you<br />
I see forgiveness<br />
I see the truth<br />
You love me for who I am<br />

Like the stars hold the moon<br />
Right there where they belong<br />
And I know I'm not alone<br />
<br />
Yeah when my world is falling apart<br />
When there's no light<br />
To break up the dark<br />
That's when I<br />
I look at you<br />

<br />
When the waves are flooding the shore<br />
And I can't find my way home any more<br />
That's when I<br />
I look at you<br />
<br />
You appear just like a dream to me<br />
Just like kaleidoscope colors that cover me<br />
All I need<br />
Every breath that I breathe<br />

Don't you know you're beautiful<br />
Yeah yeah<br />
<br />
When the waves are flooding the shore<br />
And I can't find my way home any more<br />
That's when I<br />
I look at you<br />
<br />
I look at you<br />
Yeah<br />

Whoa-oh<br />
You appear just like dream to me
