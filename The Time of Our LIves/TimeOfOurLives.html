<body>Seems like were holding on forever<br />
I gotta let it go<br />
Times up you pushed me to surrender (tonight)<br />

Who knows whats happens now whatever<br />
Where ever the wind blows<br />
And I'm there as long as were together<br />
Alright... <br />
<br />
Let's have the time of our lives!<br />
Like theres noone else around<br />
Just throw your hands up high <br />
Even when they try to take us down<br />

Let's have the time of our lives<br />
Till the lights burn out <br />
Let's laugh until we cry<br />
Life is only what you make it now<br />
Let's have the time of our lives!<br />
<br />
Dreamers don't care if its right <br />
I think im really into you<br />
Restless lets leave it all behind<br />

And Tonight<br />
<br />
Crazy when you cross my mind<br />
Oh the trouble we could get into<br />
So what lets just give this a try<br />
Alright<br />
<br />
Let's have the time of our lives!<br />
Like theres noone else around<br />
Just throw your hands up high <br />

Even when they try to take us down<br />
We'll have the time of our lives<br />
Till the lights burn out <br />
Let's laugh until we cry<br />
Life is only what you make it now<br />
Let's have the time of our lives!<br />
<br />
Lookin back what are we waitin<br />
For? <br />

Take the chance Nows all we got for sure!<br />
<br />
Let's have the time of our lives!<br />
Like theres noone else around<br />
Just throw your hands up high <br />
Even when they try to take us down<br />
We'll have the time of our lives<br />
Till the lights burn out <br />
Let's laugh until we cry<br />

Life is only what you make it now<br />
Let's have the time of our lives!
