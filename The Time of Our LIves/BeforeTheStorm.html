<body>I know this isnt what I wanted,<br />
Never thought it'd come this far,<br />
Just thinking back to where we started<br />

&amp; how we lost all that we are<br />
<br />
<i>[Nick:]</i><br />
We were young &amp; times were easy,<br />
But I could see it's not the same.<br />
I'm standing here but you don't see me,<br />
I'd give it all for that to change.<br />
And I dont want to lose her,<br />

I dont want to let her go.<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
<i>[Miley:]</i><br />
I'm standing out in the rain,<br />
I need to know if its over,<br />
Cause I will leave you alone.<br />
<br />
<i>[Nick:]</i><br />
Flooded with all this pain,<br />

Knowing that I'll never hold her,<br />
Like I did before the storm<br />
<br />
<i>[Nick:]</i><br />
And with every strike of lightning<br />
<br />
<i>[Miley:]</i><br />
Comes a memory that lasts<br />
<br />
<i>[Miley:]</i><br />

Not a word is left unspoken as the thunder starts to crash<br />
<br />
<i>[Miley:]</i><br />
Maybe I should give up<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
<i>[Miley:]</i><br />
I'm standing out in the rain,<br />
I need to know if its over,<br />
Cause I will leave you alone.<br />

<br />
<i>[Nick:]</i><br />
Flooded with all this pain,<br />
Knowing that I'll never hold her,<br />
Like I did before the storm<br />
<br />
<i>[Miley:]</i><br />
Trying to keep the light from going in<br />
<br />
<i>[Miley:]</i><br />

And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart.<br />
We always say a heart is not whole without the one who gets you through the storm.<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
Standing out in the rain, knowing that it's really over- please don't leave me alone<br />
Flooded with all this pain, knowing that I'll never hold you, like I did before the storm
