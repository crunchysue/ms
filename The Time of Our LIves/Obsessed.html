<body>Why do I just lie awake and think of you?<br />
I need some sleep.<br />
Tomorrow I have things to do.<br />

Everytime I close my eyes I see your face,<br />
So I try to read, but all I do is lose my place.<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
Am I obsessed with you?<br />
I do my best not to want you.<br />
But I do all the time.<br />
I do all the time.<br />
<br />
I just had to call you up and say hello.<br />

I know it's 3 AM.<br />
And I saw you awhile ago.<br />
But I still had this aching pain to hear your voice<br />
To know your there<br />
I don't seem to have any choice.<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
Am I obsessed with you?<br />
I do my best not to want you.<br />

But I do all the time.<br />
I do all the time.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah.<br />
I'm so sorry I just had to wake you up.<br />
I feel so lonely by myself.<br />
Is this the way it feels when you're in love?<br />
Or is this something else?<br />
Yeah.<br />

<br />
Yeeah.<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
Am I obsessed with you?<br />
I do my best not to want you.<br />
But I do all the time.<br />
I do all the time.<br />
<br />
Oooh yeah<br />

But I do all the time, I want you all the time.<br />
Am I obsessed with you?
