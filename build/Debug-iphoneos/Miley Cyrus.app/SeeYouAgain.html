<body>I got my sight set on you<br />
And I'm ready to aim<br />
I have a heart that will<br />

Never be tamed<br />
<br />
I knew you were something special<br />
When you spoke my name<br />
Now I can't wait to see you again<br />
<br />
I've got a way of knowing<br />
When something is right<br />
I feel like I must have known you<br />
In another life<br />

'cause I felt this deep connection<br />
When you looked in my eyes<br />
<br />
Now I can't wait to see you again<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
The last time I freaked out<br />
I just kept looking down<br />
I stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about<br />
Felt like I couldn't breathe<br />

You asked what's wrong with me<br />
My best friend Lesley said "Oh she's just being Miley"<br />
The next time we hang out<br />
I will redeem myself<br />
My heart can rest till then (a-whoa a-whoa)<br />
Now I can't wait to see you again<br />
<br />
I got this crazy feeling deep inside<br />
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night<br />

I'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the sign<br />
That you can't wait to see me again<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
I got my sight set on you and I'm ready to aim<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
(a-whoa a-whoa)<br />
Now I can't wait to see you again
