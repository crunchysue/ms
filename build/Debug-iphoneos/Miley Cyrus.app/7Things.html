<body>I probably shouldn't say this<br />
But at times I get so scared<br />
When I think about the previous<br />

Relationship we've shared<br />
<br />
It was awesome but we lost it<br />
It's not possible for me not to care<br />
And now we're standing in the rain<br />
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear<br />
<br />
The 7 things I hate about you<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />

The 7 things I hate about you (oh you)<br />
You're vain, your games, you're insecure<br />
You love me, you like her<br />
You make me laugh, you make me cry<br />
I don't know which side to buy<br />
Your friends they're jerks<br />
And when you act like them, just know it hurts<br />
I wanna be with the one I know<br />
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do<br />

You make me love you<br />
<br />
It's awkward and silent<br />
As I wait for you to say<br />
But what I need to hear now<br />
Is your sincere apology<br />
And when you mean it, I'll believe it<br />
If you text it, I'll delete it<br />
Let's be clear<br />

Oh I'm not coming back<br />
You're taking 7 steps here<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
And compared to all the great things<br />
That would take too long to write<br />
I probably should mention<br />
The 7 that I like<br />
<br />

The 7 things I like about you<br />
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's<br />
And when we kiss, I'm hypnotized<br />
You make me laugh, you make me cry<br />
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy<br />
Your hand in mine<br />
When we're intertwined everything's alright<br />
I want to be<br />
With the one I know<br />

And the 7th thing I like the most that you do<br />
You make me love you<br />
You do (oh)
