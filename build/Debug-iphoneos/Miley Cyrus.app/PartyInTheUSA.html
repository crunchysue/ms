<body>I hopped off the plane at L.A.X.<br />
With a dream and my cardigan<br />
Welcome to the land of fame excess,<br />

Am I gonna fit in?<br />
<br />
Jumped in the cab,<br />
Here I am for the first time<br />
Look to the right and I see the Hollywood sign<br />
This is all so crazy<br />
Everybody seems so famous<br />
<br />
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick<br />
Too much pressure and I'm nervous,<br />

That's when the taxi man turned on the radio<br />
And a Jay Z song was on<br />
And the Jay Z song was on<br />
And the Jay Z song was on<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
So I put my hands up<br />
They're playing my song,<br />
And the butterflies fly away<br />

I'm noddin' my head like yeah<br />
I'm movin' my hips like yeah<br />
I got my hands up,<br />
They're playin' my song<br />
I know I'm gonna be OK<br />
Yeah, it's a party in the USA<br />
Yeah, it's a party in the USA<br />
<br />
Get to the club in my taxi cab<br />

Everybody's lookin at me now<br />
Like "Who's that chick, that's rockin' kicks?<br />
She's gotta be from out of town"<br />
<br />
So hard with my girls not around me<br />
Its definitely not a Nashville party<br />
'cause all I see are stilettos<br />
I guess I never got the memo<br />
<br />
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick<br />

Too much pressure and I'm nervous<br />
That's when the D.J. dropped my favorite tune<br />
And a Britney song was on<br />
And the Britney song was on<br />
And the Britney song was on<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
Feel like hoppin' on a flight (on a flight)<br />
Back to my hometown tonight (town tonight)<br />

Something stops me everytime (everytime)<br />
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus x2]</i>
