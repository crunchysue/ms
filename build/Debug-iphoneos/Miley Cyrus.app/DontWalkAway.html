<body>I've been<br />
Runnin'<br />
In circles all day long<br />

I'm out<br />
Of breath<br />
But I'm still goin' strong<br />
<br />
I'm gonna get you yeah<br />
No matter what they say<br />
You think I'm losin'<br />
But I always get my way<br />
(Hey)<br />

<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
Don't walk away when I'm talkin' to you<br />
This ain't no time for your bad attitude<br />
Don't gimme<br />
That face<br />
When you know I'm really down for the chase<br />
'cause my heart's already in it<br />
And I'm never gonna quit it<br />

When you finally gonna get it<br />
Don't walk away<br />
<br />
(When I'm talkin' to you)<br />
<br />
You act<br />
Act like<br />
That I don't have a clue<br />
You think<br />
You know it all<br />

But I'm so onto you<br />
<br />
You think you've figured out<br />
Just how to win this game<br />
I'm on your tracks yeah<br />
I know every move you make<br />
(Hey)<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
<br />

I won't give up just like that<br />
I'm gonna make you mine<br />
If it takes everything I have<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus]</i><br />
<br />
(Don't walk away when I'm talkin' to you)<br />
When I'm talkin' to you<br />
(This ain't no time for your bad attitude)<br />
Yeah<br />

<br />
Don't gimme<br />
That face<br />
When you know I'm really down for the chase<br />
'cause my heart's already in it<br />
And I'm never gonna quit it<br />
When you finally gonna get it<br />
Don't walk away
