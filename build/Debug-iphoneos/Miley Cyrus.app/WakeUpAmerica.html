<body>Oh, Can we take care of her?<br />
Oh, Maybe you can spare her<br />
Several moments of your consideration<br />

Leading up to the final destination<br />
<br />
Oh, The Earth is calling out<br />
I wanna learn what it's all about but<br />
Everything I read<br />
Global warming, going green<br />
I don't know what all this means<br />
But it seems to be saying<br />
<br />
Wake up America<br />

We're all in this together<br />
It's our home so let's take care of it<br />
You know that you want to<br />
You know that you got to<br />
Wake up America<br />
Tomorrow becomes a new day<br />
And everything you do matters<br />
Yea everything you do matters in some way<br />
<br />

Stand up, I'll try if you will<br />
Wake up, it's not a fire drill<br />
All she needs is a little attention<br />
Can you give her just a little attention?<br />
<br />
Oh, it's easy to look away<br />
But it's getting harder day by day<br />
Everything I read<br />
Global warming, going green<br />

I don't know what all this means<br />
But it seems to be saying<br />
<br />
C'mon!<br />
Wake up America<br />
We're all in this together<br />
It's our home so let's take care of it<br />
You know that you want to<br />
You know that you got to<br />

Wake up America<br />
Tomorrow becomes a new day<br />
And everything you do matters<br />
Yea everything you do matters in some way<br />
<br />
I know that you don't want to hear it<br />
Especially coming from someone so young<br />
But in the backseat, yea, they want to hear it<br />
(yeah you wanna hear it)<br />

<br />
So come on, turn it up<br />
Come on, turn it up<br />
So come on (turn it up)<br />
<br />
Wake up America (wake up)<br />
We're all in this together<br />
It's our home (it's our home)<br />
So let's take care of it<br />
You know that you want to<br />

You know that you got to<br />
Wake up America<br />
Tomorrow becomes a new day<br />
And everything you do matters<br />
Yea everything you do matters in some way
