<body><i>[Verse 1:]</i><br />
After 12, not so well<br />
Won't pretend, it's too soon to tell<br />

What's round this bend?<br />
No disgrace, about face<br />
Anything not to have to chase you down again<br />
You know nothing hurts like loosing<br />
When you know it's really gone<br />
Except for the pain of choosing<br />
To hold too long<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />

I tried it your way<br />
But I got nothing to show<br />
It's been the same, same<br />
And the story's getting old<br />
So I guess the driveway<br />
Will be the end of the road<br />
For us it's too late<br />
Let the credits start to roll<br />
<br />

<i>[Verse 2:]</i><br />
A lot to say<br />
But not today<br />
Let the radio break the silence<br />
As we drive<br />
A kiss goodbye<br />
Not this time<br />
Don't remember what about this song<br />
I ever liked<br />

You know nothing hurts like loosing<br />
When you know I'm already gone<br />
Except for the pain of choosing<br />
To hold too long<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
I tried it your way<br />
But I got nothing to show<br />
It's been the same, same<br />

And the story's getting old<br />
So I guess the driveway<br />
Will be the end of the road<br />
For us it's too late<br />
Let the credits start to roll<br />
<br />
<i>[Bridge:]</i><br />
I thought maybe we were getting somewhere<br />
But we're still nowhere at all<br />

I watched your tail lights fading<br />
I try but it still won't fall<br />
I remember what it feels like to know love<br />
And have it taken away<br />
Can't think of what I've learned right now<br />
But I'll be thanking you someday<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
I tried it your way<br />

But I got nothing to show<br />
It's been the same, same<br />
And the story's getting old<br />
So I guess the driveway<br />
Will be the end of the road<br />
For us it's too late<br />
Let the credits start to roll<br />
<br />
Let the credits start to roll<br />

So I guess the driveway<br />
Will be the end of the road,<br />
End of the road
