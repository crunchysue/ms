<body>I can honestly say<br />
You've been on my mind<br />
Since I woke up today, up today<br />

I look at your photograph all the time<br />
These memories come back to life<br />
And I don't mind<br />
<br />
I remember when we kissed<br />
I still feel it on my lips<br />
The time that you danced with me<br />
With no music playing<br />
I remember those simple things<br />

I remember 'till I cry<br />
But the one thing I wish I'd forget<br />
A memory I want to forget<br />
Is goodbye<br />
<br />
I woke up this morning<br />
And played our song<br />
And through my tears I sang along<br />
I picked up the phone and than<br />

Put it down<br />
'cause I know I'm wasting my time<br />
And I don't mind<br />
<br />
I remember when we kissed<br />
I still feel it on my lips<br />
The time that you danced with me<br />
With no music playing<br />
I remember those simple things<br />

I remember 'till I cry<br />
But the one thing I wish I'd forget<br />
A memory I want to forget<br />
<br />
Suddenly my cell phone's blowing up<br />
With your ring tone<br />
I hesitate but answer it anyway<br />
You sound so alone<br />
And I'm surprised to hear you say<br />

<br />
You remember when we kissed<br />
You still feel it on your lips<br />
The time that you danced with me<br />
With no music playing<br />
You remember those simple things<br />
We talked 'till we cried<br />
You said that your biggest regret<br />
The one that you wish I'd forget<br />

Is saying goodbye<br />
<br />
Saying goodbye<br />
Oh, Goodbye
