<body>Do me a favor<br />
And tell me what you think about me<br />
Tell me how you want this to be<br />

Go out on a limb and just dream<br />
<br />
Paint a picture<br />
Choose your colors extra wise<br />
Especially what you put on my mind<br />
Imagine what it be like to touch the sky, yeah, yeah<br />
<br />
Whoa oh, your thoughts are gonna pick me up<br />
Do you know it's good to feel so much<br />
<br />

Whoa, you got my head in the clouds<br />
Whoa, you got me thinking out loud<br />
The more you dream about me the more I believe<br />
That nothing's ever out of reach<br />
So dream, dream, dream<br />
<br />
I breathe your visions<br />
They pull me through the coldest of nights<br />
They steer me towards that moment in time<br />

When you show me what it means for you to be mine, yeah<br />
Whoa, oh you're giving me the will to try<br />
Do you know that there's happy in these eyes<br />
<br />
Whoa, you got my head in the clouds<br />
Whoa, you got me thinking out loud<br />
The more you dream about me the more I believe<br />
That nothing's ever out of reach<br />
So dream, dream, dream<br />

<br />
It's like my birthday<br />
Every time you look at me<br />
It's like the best thing<br />
Every time that you dream, yeah, yeah, yeah<br />
<br />
Whoa oh, your thoughts are gonna pick me up<br />
Do you know it's good to feel too much<br />
<br />
Whoa, you got my head in the clouds<br />

Whoa, you got me thinking out loud<br />
The more you dream about me the more I believe<br />
That nothing's ever out of reach<br />
So dream, dream, dream<br />
<br />
The more you dream about me the more that I believe<br />
That nothing's ever out of reach<br />
So dream, dream, dream,<br />
Dream
