<body>You don't understand what it is<br />
That makes me tick<br />
But you wish you did<br />

You always second guess,wonder if i say yes<br />
but you just lose out every time<br />
<br />
If you only knew what i talked about<br />
When I'm with my friends just hangin' out<br />
Then you'd have the inside scoop<br />
On what to say, what to do<br />
That way when you play the game<br />
Baby you could never lose<br />

<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall<br />
A creepy little sneaky little Fly on the Wall<br />
All my precious secrets, yeah<br />
You'd know them all<br />
Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall<br />
<br />
You'd love to know, the things I do<br />
When I'm with my friends, and not with you<br />

Your always second guess, wonder if<br />
There's other guys im flirting with<br />
You should know by now<br />
<br />
If you were my boyfriend, I'd be true to you<br />
If I make a promise, I'm comin' thru<br />
Don't you wish that you could<br />
See me every second of the day<br />
That way you would have no doubt<br />

That baby i would never stray<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall<br />
A creepy little sneaky little Fly on the Wall<br />
All my precious secrets, yeah<br />
You'd know them all<br />
Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall<br />
<br />
A little communication<br />

Well that'll go a long way<br />
You're getting misinformation<br />
Too much hearsay, hearsay<br />
<br />
and what i say is<br />
come a little closer<br />
And what I'm gonna say is<br />
<br />
Don't You<br />
Don't You<br />

Don't You<br />
Don't you wish you were a...<br />
Hey!<br />
<br />
<i>[Chorus:]</i><br />
Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall<br />
A creepy little sneaky little Fly on the Wall<br />
All my precious secrets, yeah<br />
You'd know them all<br />

Don't you wish that you could be a Fly on the Wall
