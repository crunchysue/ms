<body>It's been in the past for a while<br />

I get a flash and I smile<br />
Am I crazy?<br />
Still miss you baby<br />
<br />
It was real, it was right<br />
But it burned too hot to survive<br />
All that's left is<br />
All these ashes<br />
<br />
Where does the love go?<br />

I don't know<br />
When it's all said and done<br />
How could I be losing you forever?<br />
After all the time we spent together<br />
<br />
I have to know why<br />
I had to lose you<br />
Now you've just become<br />
Like everything I'll never find again<br />

At the bottom of the ocean<br />
<br />
Do do do<br />
Do do do do<br />
Do do do do do do do<br />
Do do do do do do do<br />
<br />
In a dream you appeared<br />
For a while you were here<br />
So I keep sleeping<br />

Just to keep you with me<br />
<br />
I'll draw a map<br />
Connect the dots<br />
With all the memories that I've got<br />
What I'm missing<br />
I'll keep re-living<br />
<br />
Where does the love go?<br />
I don't know<br />

When it's all said and done<br />
How could I be losing you forever?<br />
After all the time we spent together<br />
<br />
I have to know why<br />
I had to lose you<br />
Now you've just become<br />
Like everything I'll never find again<br />
At the bottom of the ocean<br />

<br />
<i>[speaking:]</i><br />
This is it<br />
Let go<br />
Breathe<br />
<br />
<i>[sung:]</i><br />
You'll have to love me<br />
For me to, baby, ever understand<br />
Just know I love the time that we both had<br />

And I don't ever want to see you sad, be happy<br />
Cause I don't want to hold you<br />
If you don't want to tell me you love me babe<br />
Just know I'm gonna have to walk away<br />
I'll be big enough for both of us to say, be happy<br />
<br />
Do do do<br />
Do do do do (be happy)<br />
Do do do do do do do (be happy)<br />

Do do do do do do do<br />
Be happy<br />
<br />
Mmmm....<br />
Be happy
