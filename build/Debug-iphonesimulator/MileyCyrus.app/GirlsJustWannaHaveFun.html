<body>I come home in the morning light<br />
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?"<br />
Oh mother dear we're not the fortunate ones<br />
And girls they wanna have fun<br />
Oh girls just wanna have fun<br />

<br />
The phone rings in the middle of the night<br />
My father yells, "what you gonna do with your life?"<br />
Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one<br />
And girls, they wanna have fun<br />
Oh girls just wanna have<br />
<br />
That's all they really want<br />
Some fun<br />
When the working day is done<br />

Oh girls they wanna have fun<br />
Oh girls just wanna have fun<br />
<br />
(Girls they wanna, wanna have fun)<br />
(Girls, they wanna have)<br />
<br />
Some boys take a beautiful girl<br />
And hide her away from the rest of the world<br />
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun<br />
Oh girls they wanna have fun<br />

Oh girls just wanna have<br />
<br />
That's all they really want<br />
Some fun<br />
When the working day is done<br />
Oh girls they wanna have fun<br />
Oh girls just wanna have fun<br />
<br />
(Girls they wanna, wanna have fun)<br />
(Girls, they wanna have)<br />

<br />
They just wanna, they just wanna<br />
They just wanna, they just wanna<br />
<br />
That's all they really want<br />
Some fun<br />
When the working day is done<br />
Oh girls they wanna have fun<br />
Oh girls just wanna have fun<br />
<br />

(Girls they wanna, wanna have fun)<br />
(Girls, they wanna have)<br />
<br />
When the working,when the working<br />
When the working day is done<br />
Oh when the working day is done<br />
Oh girls the wanna have fun<br />
<br />
(Girls they wanna, wanna have fun) (have fun)<br />
(Girls, they wanna have)<br />

<br />
(Girls they wanna, wanna have fun)<br />
(They wanna have fun)<br />
(Girls, they wanna have)
