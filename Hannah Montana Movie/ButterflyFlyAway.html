<body>You tuck me in,<br />
Turn out the light<br />
kept me safe and sound at night<br />

little girls depend on things like that<br />
<br />
Brush my teeth and combed my hair<br />
had to drive me everywhere<br />
you were always there when I looked back<br />
<br />
You had to do it all alone<br />
Make a live, make a home<br />
Must have been as hard as it could be<br />
<br />

And when I couldn't sleep at night<br />
Scare things wouldn't turn out right<br />
you would hold my hand and sing to me<br />
<br />
Caterpillar in the tree, how you wonder who you'll be<br />
can't go far but you can always dream<br />
Wish you may and wish you might<br />
don't you worry hold on tight.<br />
I promise you there will come a day<br />

Butterfly Fly Away<br />
Butterfly Fly Away (butterfly fly away)<br />
<br />
Catch your wing now you cant stay<br />
Take those dreams and make them all come true<br />
Butterfly Fly Away (butterfly fly away)<br />
We been waiting for this day<br />
All along and know just what to do<br />
Butterfly,Butterfly,Butterfly,<br />

Butterfly Fly Away<br />

(Butterfly Fly Away)<br />
