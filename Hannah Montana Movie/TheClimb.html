<body>I can almost see it.<br />
That dream I'm dreaming, but<br />
There's a voice inside my head saying<br />

You'll never reach it<br />
Every step I'm takin'<br />
Every move I make<br />
Feels lost with no direction,<br />
My faith is shakin'<br />
But I gotta keep tryin'<br />
Gotta keep my head held high<br />
<br />
There's always gonna be another mountain<br />

I'm always gonna wanna make it move<br />
Always gonna be an uphill battle<br />
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose<br />
Ain't about how fast I get there<br />
Ain't about what's waitin' on the other side<br />
It's the climb<br />
<br />
The struggles I'm facing<br />
The chances I'm taking<br />

Sometimes might knock me down, but<br />
No I'm not breaking<br />
I may not know it, but<br />
These are the moments that<br />
I'm gonna remember most<br />
I've just gotta keep goin', and<br />
I gotta be strong<br />
Just keep pushing on, but<br />
<br />

There's always gonna be another mountain<br />
I'm always gonna wanna make it move<br />
Always gonna be an uphill battle<br />
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose<br />
Ain't about how fast I get there<br />
Ain't about what's waitin' on the other side<br />
It's the climb<br />
<br />
There's always gonna be another mountain<br />

I'm always gonna wanna make it move<br />
Always gonna be an uphill battle<br />
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose<br />
Ain't about how fast I get there<br />
Ain't about what's waitin' on the other side<br />
It's the climb<br />
<br />
Keep on movin'<br />
Keep climbin'<br />

Keep faith baby<br />
It's all about, it's all about<br />
The climb<br />
Keep the faith, keep your faith, woah
