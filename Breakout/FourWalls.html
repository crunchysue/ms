<body>These four walls<br />
They whisper to me<br />
They know a secret<br />

I knew they would not keep<br />
It didn't take long<br />
For the room to fill with dust<br />
And these four walls came down around us<br />
<br />
It must have been something to send me out of my head<br />
With the words so radical and not what I meant<br />
Now I wait<br />
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left<br />

Just me and these four walls again<br />
<br />
It's hard now to let you be<br />
I won't make excuses<br />
I've made my peace<br />
It didn't take long<br />
For me to lose the trust<br />
'Cause these four walls<br />
Were not strong enough<br />

<br />
It must have been something to send me out of my head<br />
With the words so radical and not what I meant<br />
Now I wait<br />
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left<br />
Just me and these four walls again<br />
<br />
Yeah<br />
It's difficult<br />
Watching us fade<br />

Knowing it's all my fault<br />
My mistake<br />
Yeah, and it's difficult<br />
Letting you down<br />
Knowing it's all my fault<br />
You're not around<br />
<br />
It must have been something to send me out of my head<br />
With the words so radical and not what I meant<br />

Now I wait<br />
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left<br />
Just me and these four walls again
